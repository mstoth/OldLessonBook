    <br>
    As you add pieces to a lesson, your database<br>
    of pieces grows.&nbsp; You should only have to <br>
    enter a piece once by typing the values in.&nbsp; <br>
    After that you can choose it from the picker.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    The left sideof the picker is the title of the <br>
    piece and the right side is the composer. <br>
    If you change the&nbsp; composer, only that <br>
    composer's pieces will be displayed on the<br>
    left side of the picker. <br>
    <br>
    Selecting the difficulty bar values will limit<br>
    the choices to pieces with those levels of<br>
    difficulty.&nbsp; It does not have to be used.&nbsp; It is<br>
    only there as a convenience if desired. <br>
    <br>
    Pressing "Clear" clears all the fields and the<br>
    difficulty bar. <br>
