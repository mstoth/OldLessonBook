        <br>
        <small><small><small><big>The Piece Detail Page is what you will
                be<br>
                viewing most of the time during a lesson. <br>
                This page has a place called "Goals:" to put<br>
                instructions for the student. <br>
                <br>
                There is a built-in metronome with a slider<br>
                as well as a text box to type values in. <br>
                <br>
                There is an automatic timer that starts when <br>
                you go to this page.&nbsp;&nbsp; This allows you to <br>
                time how long you are spending on a piece<br>
                during a lesson.&nbsp; It also works for the student<br>
                by allowing them to monitor how much time<br>
                they spend practicing on each piece. <br>
                <br>
                There is a built-in recorder which can be used <br>
                to record one recording per piece per lesson.<br>
                It is really meant as a scratch pad for audible<br>
                information you want to pass on to the student. <br>
                The recording can be sent via Bluetooth or <br>
                email.&nbsp; Sending a recording by Bluetooth can<br>
                take a while but if you are patient it can be done.<br>
